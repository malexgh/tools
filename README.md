# Tools

Simple tools I built

## adb-checker

It searches for 'adb.exe' and checks the version of each one of them. I built it becouse I had some problems with diferent versions of adb on my computer.

[Python](https://www.python.org) - This tool needs Python 3.5 or later

### Command line

python adb-checker [path_to_search]
